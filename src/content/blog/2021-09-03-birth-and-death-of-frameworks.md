What's your favourite framework? Do you use it every day at your job or rather in hobby projects? What do you like about it? Rails, React, Laravel, Spring, .NET?  

Eric Evans gave a talk a few years ago about our favourite frameworks and libraries. He took a popular Java time library — Joda Time — and wondered if it was the best solution out there. It certainly was the most used one. What follows is Eric's thought experiment about thinking about of the box, rethinking domain problems from scratch. 

This talk is fascinating to me: Eric doesn't take a given popular solution for granted, instead he meticulously considers all the pros and cons. It doesn't mean that his alternative solution to handling time is production ready in any way, but at least he critically looked and its possible solutions.

Of course, one of the requirements of writing and maintaining a popular library over the years is stability, you can't rethink your solution every other year, that would be a massive burden on your users. That means that stability is a requirement, but also a limiting factor in making great software.

And yet, once in a while, every few years or so, developers tend to get an urge for something new. Sometimes this leads to the next great thing.

If you wait long enough, all popular frameworks and libraries will reach their limits when it comes to popularity, and people will start to create alternative solutions.

## Methodology

There's no one dataset that can accurately represents these worldwide trends while taking all variables into account. This is why we can only draw conclusions based on the relative changes we see within individual datasets, and compare those relative changes across datasets to validate whether they hold true.

You can refer to these pages if want to read more about JetBrains' and StackOverflow's methodology:

- [https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2021/methodology/](*https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2021/methodology/)
- [https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#methodology](*https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#methodology)

Furthermore, note that all google trends are scoped the same way:

- All time data
- Worldwide
- The Computers & Electronics category

Also note the consistent dip in Google Trends around September, 2020; this is due to changes made to Google's algorithm at that time.
