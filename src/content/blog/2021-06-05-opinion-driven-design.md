A common pitfall in software design is trying to please everyone, or at least as many people as possible.

I've been programming for almost 15 years now, and doing quite a lot of [open source](*https://spatie.be/open-source?search=&sort=-downloads) as well these recent years. There's one principle I've become more and more convinced about over the years: don't try to please everyone â€” and this especially holds true when it comes to open source.

When trying to please everyone, you'll end up with a product that's:

- overly complex to use;
- often mediocre in many areas; and
- a mess to maintain.

Instead, I find it better to carefully think about your opinion and hold on to it. 

We should focus more on building opinionated software that only provides one way of doing something, while also making sure that that one way is the absolute best way you can think of.

Some people might not like your opinionated design, and that's fine. They aren't forced to use it. In reality though, it often doesn't matter that much to most people, as long as your solution solves their problems.

This way of opinion-driven design has a few advantages:

- you show you're a master in your field
- software becomes easier to use, since there aren't n-amount of ways to do the same thing;
- 

Don't take my word for it though, instead look at the greatest software architects that came before us: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Udi0rk3jZYM
