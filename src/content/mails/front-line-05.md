In today's video, we take a look at an addition to PHP's type system. I'm a big fan of static analysis, so the more of these changes, the better.

We've open sourced one of the chapters of [Front Line PHP](https://front-line-php.com/) by the way, it's about how PHP deals with `null`, an important part of its type system. You can [read it here](https://front-line-php.com/dealing-with-null).

We'll continue with another addition to PHP's type system tomorrow. 

Until then!
