I mentioned my second favourite feature of PHP 8.1 in yesterday's mail: it's being able to use the new keyword in initializers.

What's that? You might be wondering. Well, you know how you can assign a default value to a function's argument? Like the empty string for $title, for example:

<pre><code class="language-php hljs php" data-lang="php"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">BlogData</span>
</span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">__construct</span><span class="hljs-params">(
        <span class="hljs-highlight  keyword">public readonly</span> <span class="hljs-highlight  type">string</span> <span class="hljs-highlight  prop">$title</span> = <span class="hljs-string">''</span>,
        <span class="hljs-highlight  keyword">public readonly</span> <span class="hljs-highlight  type">State</span> <span class="hljs-highlight  prop">$state</span>,
    )</span> </span>{}
}</code></pre>

Do you want to make a guess about what's new in PHP 8.1? You're probably right! We can now specify default objects as well, not just scalar values!

<pre><code class="language-php hljs php" data-lang="php"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">BlogData</span>
</span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">__construct</span><span class="hljs-params">(
        <span class="hljs-highlight  keyword">…</span> <span class="hljs-highlight  type">string</span> <span class="hljs-highlight  prop">$title</span> = <span class="hljs-string">''</span>,
        <span class="hljs-highlight  keyword">…</span> <span class="hljs-highlight  type">State</span> <span class="hljs-highlight  prop">$state</span> = <span class="hljs-highlight  keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-highlight  type">Draft</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span>,
    )</span> </span>{}
}</code></pre>

This is one of those changes that makes me really happy: I've been missing this feature as long as I've been writing PHP, so it's great to see it finally being added!

You might be wondering about the line length of these property definition though, I even had to collapse the public readonly part just to make sure everything fit into this mail.

I personally wouldn't worry too much about it: I think it's better to have slightly longer lines, than having to deal with a class that's ten times longer (remember the pre-PHP 7.4 example from the previous mail).

I'm sure we'll get used to it fairly quickly, and with the right colour coding in your IDE, you'll be able to quickly understand this code at a glance, no problem.

Oh, one more thing: I used method argument defaults as an example here, but I should note that the new keyword can now also be used in attributes, which basically allows for nested attributes!

<pre><code class="language-php hljs php" data-lang="php"><span class="hljs-comment">#[<span class="hljs-highlight  type">Assert\All</span>(</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-highlight  type">Assert\NotNull</span>, 
    <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-highlight  type">Assert\Length</span>(<span class="hljs-highlight  prop">max</span>: <span class="hljs-number">6</span>),
<span class="hljs-highlight  comment">)]</span></code></pre>

A few days ago, I mentioned that PHP 8.1 is matching PHP 8.0 in terms of awesome new features, and this one definitely contributes to the awesomeness-factor!

And we're not done yet; there's more to come. But that'll have to wait, until tomorrow!
