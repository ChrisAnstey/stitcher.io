Array unpacking has been in PHP since PHP 7.4, though with a significant limitation: only arrays with numeric keys were allowed. So this was already possible:

<pre><code class="language-php hljs php" data-lang="php">$arrayA = [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>];

$arrayB = [<span class="hljs-number">4</span>, <span class="hljs-number">5</span>];

$result = [<span class="hljs-number">0</span>, ...$arrayA, ...$arrayB, <span class="hljs-number">6</span>, <span class="hljs-number">7</span>];

<span class="hljs-comment">// [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]</span></code></pre>

However, the following was not â€” that is, until PHP 8.1:

<pre><code class="language-php hljs php" data-lang="php">$arrayA = [<span class="hljs-string">'a'</span> => <span class="hljs-number">1</span>];

$arrayB = [<span class="hljs-string">'b'</span> => <span class="hljs-number">2</span>];

$result = [<span class="hljs-string">'a'</span> => <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, ...$arrayA, ...$arrayB];

<span class="hljs-comment">// ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2]</span></code></pre>

The way array unpacking with string keys works, by the way, is exactly the same as how array_merge works, meaning there's nothing new to learn about how arrays with the same keys are unpacked: it works the same as we're used to.

A neat little addition, if you'd ask me; one that'll come in handy in a few places!

Until tomorrow!
