We want to send you a quick update from the team here at Spatie about [Front Line PHP](https://front-line-php.com/) and PHP 8.1. 

First of all: we're working on a PHP 8.1 related update for the book that will be free for everyone who already bought the course. There'll be 6 new chapters, as well as numerous updates to existing chapters. We plan on releasing this update somewhere in November.

Second, we've created some more PHP 8.1 related content in the form of free videos for everyone. By subscribing to [this mailing list](https://front-line-php.com/#php-81), you'll receive a daily video for the next week, each day showing a new PHP 8.1 feature in practice. 

We hope you're as excited about PHP 8.1 as we are, it's going to be a great release!

Until next time!

Brent & the team at Spatie
