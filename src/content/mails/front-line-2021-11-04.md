With PHP 8.1 right around the corner, we're excited to announce the new version of Front Line PHP! It includes several new chapters on PHP 8.1 related topics, as well as lots of updates across existing chapters. 

In total there are **6 brand new chapters**:

- Readonly properties
- Enums
- First class callables
- New in initializers
- Fibers
- Static analysers in practice

The best news: you'll get all of this content **for free** if you've bought the book before! You can head over to [your Spatie purchases](https://spatie.be/profile/purchases) and download the updated PDF, or you can [buy the book](https://spatie.be/products/front-line-php) if you haven't done so.

At Spatie, we're looking forward to start using PHP 8.1, and we hope our book will help you to get the quick start you need!

Until next time!

Brent & the team at Spatie
