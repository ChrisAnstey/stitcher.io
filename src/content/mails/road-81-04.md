Pure intersection types might seem a little obscure if you haven't used them before with static analysers, though they are fairly easy to explain. You already know the union type, right? This one says that "the type of $foo should be A or B":

<pre><code class="language-php hljs php" data-lang="php"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">test</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-highlight  type">A</span>|<span class="hljs-highlight  type">B</span> $foo)</span> </span>{ <span class="hljs-comment">/* … */</span> }</code></pre>

And so, you might have already guessed it, an intersection type says the type should be A and B:

<pre><code class="language-php hljs php" data-lang="php"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">test</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-highlight  type">A</span>&amp;<span class="hljs-highlight  type">B</span> $foo)</span> </span>{ <span class="hljs-comment">/* … */</span> }</code></pre>

When would this be useful though?

Let me give an example: let's imagine you've got two interfaces, one called WithUuid, the other one is called WithSlug. I reckon it's pretty clear from the names what they do, but just to make sure we're on the same line, here are both those interfaces:

<pre><code class="language-php hljs php" data-lang="php"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">interface</span> <span class="hljs-title">WithUuid</span>
</span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">getUuid</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span>: <span class="hljs-title">Uuid</span></span>;
}

<span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">interface</span> <span class="hljs-title">WithSlug</span>
</span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">getSlug</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span>: <span class="hljs-title">string</span></span>;
}</code></pre>

Now imagine you've got a function that only works with objects that both have a UUID and a slug. Maybe a function that generates a url for such an object:

<pre><code class="language-php hljs php" data-lang="php"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">url</span><span class="hljs-params">($object)</span>: <span class="hljs-title">string</span> </span>{ <span class="hljs-comment">/* … */</span> }</code></pre>

How would you type-hint such a function so that you're sure you'll only get objects that implement both? You can't use a union type because that would also accept objects that implement only one of the interfaces.

So the only solution, prior to PHP 8.1, was to make a new interface that extends both WithUuid and WithSlug:

<pre><code class="language-php hljs php" data-lang="php"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">interface</span> <span class="hljs-title">WithUrl</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">extends</span> <span class="hljs-title">WithUuid</span>, <span class="hljs-title">WithSlug</span>
</span>{}</code></pre>

And so, that's where intersection types come in: they add more flexibility for using types, without the need of creating new interfaces all over the place.

<pre><code class="language-php hljs php" data-lang="php"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">url</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-highlight  type">WithUuid</span>&amp;<span class="hljs-highlight  type">WithSlug</span> $object)</span>: <span class="hljs-highlight  type"><span class="hljs-title">string</span></span> 
</span>{ <span class="hljs-comment">/* … */</span> }</code></pre>

Pretty neat! I can actually think of a few places in my projects where this will come in handy.

One important caveat to mention: pure intersection types don't support null at the moment. If we wanted our url function to either accept an object implementing the right interfaces or null, you wouldn't be able to use an intersection type right now. There's actually [an RFC](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/nullable_intersection_types) still being discussed to allow this behaviour in PHP 8.1, but it's possible it will get postponed to PHP 8.2. We'll see.

Anyway, intersection types are definitely a great addition to PHP's type system, and I'm looking forward to using them!

Until tomorrow!
