In today's mail, we look at a new type added in PHP 8.1 that's specifically designed to work with static analysers.

I'm adding a whole new chapter to [Front Line PHP](https://front-line-php.com/) about static analysers, by the way; if you bought the book before you'll get it for free once it's done!

For now, this was the last video in this series; we'll notify you when we've made new ones though. Until next time!
