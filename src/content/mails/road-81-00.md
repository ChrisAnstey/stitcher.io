If you're reading this mail, you're probably as excited as I am for PHP 8.1. Who would have thought that after the feature-packed PHP 8 release, the next one would be almost as exciting?

There's lots of ground to cover: from enums to improved class properties, callables, array unpacking and more. So, here's the deal:

In the next ten days, you'll receive a daily email highlighting a new PHP 8.1 feature. After those ten days, you'll be unsubscribed from this list and won't receive any more email.

I will mention my main mailing list and book about modern PHP at the very end of this series though, so if you're interested in more, make sure to look out for those links at the end!

I hope you enjoy this series, remember you can always hit "reply" to send me your feedback.

With all of that being said, expect one mail per day for the next ten days. The first one should arrive right about… now! (Or a little later, depending on how busy the mailing list is at the moment…)

Kind regards

Brent
