It's another day, and time for another PHP 8.1 video! Today's video is about a small little detail, but one that will definitely have a lasting impact.

PHP 8.1 is shaping up to be an awesome update, did you know that everyone who bought our [Front Line PHP course](https://front-line-php.com/) will get the updated 8.1 version for free?

We'll see each other tomorrow!
