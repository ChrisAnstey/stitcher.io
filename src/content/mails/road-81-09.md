It sounds like it could be the title of a movie: **The Never Type**, it's unfortunately a little less exciting than that: it's a way to indicate that a function will **never** return.

How is that different from void? How's that possible? I'm happy to shed some light on the matter.

The never type was an RFC proposed by Matt Brown and Ondřej Mirtes, the authors of Psalm and PHPStan (two static analysers for PHP). Its goal is to indicate that a function will never return, meaning that it'll either throw an exception or that it will exit the script.

There's the difference with void, which indicates that the function returns nothing, compared to not returning at all.

Imagine a function like this one:

<pre><code class="language-php hljs php" data-lang="php"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">redirect</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-highlight  type">string</span> $uri)</span>: <span class="hljs-title">never</span>
</span>{
    <span class="hljs-highlight  prop">header</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Location: {$uri}"</span>);
    
    <span class="hljs-keyword">exit</span>;
}</code></pre>

Calling such a function means that whatever code comes after it, will not be executed, where void only indicates the function returns nothing. By adding the never type, static analysers can get more insights in the possible paths your code will take, and make assertions based on that.

So, I reckon it's a niche feature, though I — a happy user of static analysis — quite like it.

We're nearing the end of our 10-day Road to PHP 8.1, tomorrow will be the very last mail you'll receive.

Until then!
