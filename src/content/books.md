I've had the pleasure of creating several courses at [Spatie](*https://spatie.be/), and I'd like to keep track of them on my blog as well.

## Event Sourcing in Laravel

Everything you need to learn about starting with event sourcing is covered in this course: from learning about event driven design and events to aggregates, projections, process managers, CQRS and more. Not only are all patterns and principles covered, we also discuss many common pitfalls of an event sourced system, and how to avoid them.
